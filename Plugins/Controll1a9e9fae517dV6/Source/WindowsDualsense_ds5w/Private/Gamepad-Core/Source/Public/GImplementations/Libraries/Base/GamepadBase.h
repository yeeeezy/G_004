 * @class GamepadBase
 * @brief An abstract base class derived from the ISonyGamepad interface.
 *
 * The GamepadBase class serves as a foundational class for implementing
 * gamepad functionality specific to Sony devices. It inherits from the
 * ISonyGamepad interface, which provides methods and features for managing
 * gamepad status, lightbar, sensors, touch input, triggers, audio-driven
 * haptics, and more.
 *
 * Classes inheriting from GamepadBase are expected to implement the
 * behaviors defined by the ISonyGamepad interface.

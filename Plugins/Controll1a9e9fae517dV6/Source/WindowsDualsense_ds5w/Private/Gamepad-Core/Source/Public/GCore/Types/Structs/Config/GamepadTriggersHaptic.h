/**
 * @class FGamepadTriggersHaptic
 * @brief Represents haptic feedback functionalities for triggers in a game
 * context.
 *
 * The FHapticTriggers class is designed to control and simulate haptic feedback
 * for trigger inputs in supported devices. This allows developers to integrate
 * tactile sensations for enhanced user immersion and interactivity.
 *
 * This class provides a structure to define properties and features for haptic
 * trigger effects, such as intensity, vibration pattern, and other
 * configuration options that are specific to the haptic feedback mechanism.
 *
 * It is typically used in conjunction with input devices, such as game
 * controllers or other peripherals, to create a responsive and engaging user
 * experience.

 * @class FGamepadOutput
 *
 * A class designed to handle the composition and management of output data
 * for PlayStation controllers, such as DualSense and DualShock devices.
 * It facilitates data formatting, calculation of CRC32 for integrity checks,
 * and configuration of various output features including haptic triggers,
 * LEDs, and audio settings. The class also provides utilities for managing
 * device contexts.

/**
 * Interface for platform-specific hardware information and operations.
 *
 * This class serves as a base interface for interacting with hardware devices
 * in a platform-agnostic manner. Derived classes must implement the provided
 * pure virtual methods to enable functionality specific to their platform or
 * device type.
 *
 * The design of the interface includes methods for creating and managing device
 * handles, reading and writing data, detecting devices, and handling cleanup
 * or invalidation. Additionally, it provides a mechanism for accessing a
 * singleton instance for the platform-specific implementation of the interface.
